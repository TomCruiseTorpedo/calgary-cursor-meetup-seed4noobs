# Python Setup (Unified for macOS & Windows)

This guide shows beginners how to install Python, create and activate a virtual environment, install packages, and run Python code. These steps work the same for both macOS (using Zsh) and Windows (using PowerShell).

    Target Python version: Python 3.12.12

---

## ⚠️ Before You Begin — First Time on This Computer?

**If this is a brand new or freshly wiped computer with nothing installed, start here first:**

- 🖥️ **New to everything?** → Start with [SETUP_FROM_SCRATCH.md](SETUP_FROM_SCRATCH.md)
- 🍎 **On a Mac?** → Install Homebrew first: [HOMEBREW_INSTALL.md](HOMEBREW_INSTALL.md)
- 🪟 **On Windows?** → Follow [WINDOWS_SETUP.md](WINDOWS_SETUP.md)

Once you've installed the basics (Git, terminal, etc.), come back here to set up Python specifically.

---

## 1) Check if Python is Already Installed

Open your terminal or PowerShell and run:

`python --version`

If that doesn’t show a version, try:

`python3 --version`

If you see something like:

Python 3.12.x

then Python is already installed. If not, proceed to install it.

---

## 2) Install Python (if not already installed)

If you came from [SETUP_FROM_SCRATCH.md](SETUP_FROM_SCRATCH.md) or ran the bootstrap script, Python is already installed — skip to Step 3.

Otherwise:

**Mac (via Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install python
```

**Windows (via winget):**
```powershell
winget install --id Python.Python.3.12 -e --source winget
```

**Direct installer (either OS):** Download from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
On Windows, check **”Add Python 3.x to PATH”** on the first installer screen — easy to miss, breaks everything if skipped.

---

## 3) Verify the Installation

After installing, open a fresh terminal and run:

`python --version`

If that doesn’t work, try:

`python3 --version`

You should see:

Python 3.12.x

If you don’t, double-check that Python was installed correctly.

---

## 4) What Is pip?

pip is Python’s package manager — it lets you install other libraries and tools.

Check if it’s available by running:

`pip --version`

If that doesn’t work:

`python -m pip --version`

---

## 5) Create a Project Folder

Pick a name for your project and make a folder:

`mkdir my_python_project`

`cd my_python_project`

---

## 6) Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment isolates your Python packages so different projects don’t conflict.

Create one with:

`python -m venv venv`

This makes a folder called venv with its own Python installation.

---

## 7) Activate the Virtual Environment

### Windows (PowerShell)

`.\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1`

If you see an execution policy warning, run PowerShell as Administrator and enter:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

---

### macOS (Zsh)

`source venv/bin/activate`

When the virtual environment is active, your prompt will start with (venv).

---

## 8) Install Packages with pip

Once the virtual environment is active, install packages like this:

`pip install <package_name>`

For example:

`pip install flask`

---

## 9) Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When you’re done working in this project, run:

`deactivate`

Your prompt will return to normal.

---

## Why Use Virtual Environments?

Virtual environments:

- Keep project dependencies separate
- Prevent version conflicts
- Make your project easier to share
- Keep your system Python clean

---

## Quick Checklist

- Installed Python 3.x  
- Verified Python runs in the terminal/PowerShell  
- Created a project folder  
- Created a virtual environment  
- Activated the virtual environment  
- Installed at least one package

## Tip for Absolute Beginners

If you want a friendly, all-in-one Python editor that includes Python and a beginner interface, you can explore Thonny (<https://thonny.org>). It’s not required for this hackathon but is a nice tool when learning Python.

## ⚡ Once You’re Comfortable — Look Into `uv`

After you’ve worked with pip and venv for a while and feel comfortable, look into **uv** — a modern Python package manager that replaces pip, venv, and pyenv in one fast tool.

```bash
# Install
brew install uv        # Mac
winget install astral-sh.uv  # Windows

# Use (same concepts, faster)
uv venv                # creates a virtual environment
uv pip install flask   # installs packages
```

It’s not needed to start — all tutorials and Stack Overflow answers use pip/venv, so stick with those while you’re learning. `uv` is the direction the Python ecosystem is heading when you’re ready to level up.
