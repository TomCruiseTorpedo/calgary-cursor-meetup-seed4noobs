# Vibe Coding — Quick Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet summarizes essential commands, concepts, and quick references
for beginners setting up their environment and building simple MVPs.
Assumes Python 3.12+ and Node 22 LTS.

## 🧰 Terminal Basics (macOS + Windows PowerShell)

Navigation:
Use `pwd` to print the current directory, `ls` to list files, `cd folder` to change into a folder, `cd ..` to go up one level, `mkdir newdir` to create a new directory, and `clear` or `cls` to clear the terminal.

---

## 🐍 Python (3.12+) Quick Commands

Check your Python version with `python --version`.  
To create a virtual environment, run `python -m venv venv`.  
To activate on macOS Zsh, run `source venv/bin/activate`.  
To activate on Windows PowerShell, run `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`.  
To install dependencies, run `pip install <package>`.  
To deactivate the virtual environment, run `deactivate`.

---

## 📦 Node (v22) & TypeScript Essentials

Use `nvm install 22` and `nvm use 22` to install and switch to the correct Node version.  
Check Node and npm with `node --version` and `npm --version`.  
Initialize a project using `npm init -y`.  
Add TypeScript with `npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node` then `npx tsc --init`.  
Compile TypeScript by running `npx tsc`.

## 🔑 SSH Key (one-time setup)

Generate: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@email.com"` → press Enter twice to accept defaults.
Mac — add to keychain: `ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
Windows — add to agent: `ssh-add $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519`
Copy public key → Mac: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy` / Windows: `Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | Set-Clipboard`
Paste at: https://github.com/settings/ssh/new

---

## 📌 Git & GitHub Basics

Configure Git globally with `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`.  
Connect to GitHub (one-time): `gh auth login` → choose GitHub.com → HTTPS → follow browser prompt.  
Check status with `git status`, stage changes with `git add .`, commit with `git commit -m "message"`, and push with `git push`.  
Clone a repo using `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`.  
Create a branch with `git checkout -b feature/description`.

---

## 🧠 Python Reference Tips

Check pip with `pip --version`.  
Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
Run your Python app with `python app.py`.

---

## 📗 JavaScript/TypeScript Reference Tips

Install packages with `npm install <pkg>`, install dev tools with `npm install --save-dev <pkg>`.  
Run a linter (if configured) with `npx eslint .`.  
Compile TypeScript using `npx tsc`.

## 🧩 Helpful Concepts (Plain English)

**Terminal / CLI**: a text interface where you type commands instead of clicking.  
**Virtual Environment (venv)**: an isolated Python workspace so packages don’t interfere across projects.  
**nvm**: Node Version Manager, used to install and switch among Node versions.  
**Linting**: automated tools (like ESLint) that check your code for style and mistakes.  
**Typing**: adding type information to code (TypeScript or Python type hints) to catch errors early.

---

## 🛠 Common Issues & Fixes

If a command is “not found,” make sure you reopened your terminal after installing a tool.  
On **macOS**, ensure nvm is loaded in your shell profile.  
On **Windows**, if PowerShell blocks a script, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.

---

## 🚀 Starter Templates — How to Run

**Python Starter App**:
Change directory to `templates/python/starter_app`.  
Create a venv using `python -m venv venv`.  
Activate it (macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`; Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`).  
Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
Run the app with `python app.py`.

**TS Starter App**:
Change directory to `templates/js_ts/starter_app`.  
Install dependencies with `npm install`.  
Compile TypeScript using `npx tsc`.  
Open `index.html` in your browser.  
Optional local server: install and run using `npx serve .`.

## 🌐 Deployment (Vercel) Quick Steps

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel.  
2. Select the project and configure build settings.  
3. Trigger the first deploy.  
4. Open the live URL to verify the deployment.

## 🤖 AI / Cursor Interaction Tips

**Token strategy:** Start in **Plan Mode with the most capable model** — scope the work, agree on a spec or roadmap, and lock in the plan before writing any code. Switch to **Agent/Execute mode** to implement. Once the spec is well-defined, step down to a cheaper/faster model for execution.

**Plan Mode prompt example**: “Plan steps to get my environment ready and an MVP built in 90 ~ 120 minutes.”  
Ask for explanations using: “Explain this command in plain English.”  
Ask for user readiness: “Are you ready for me to paste this into your terminal?”
