This is a clear guide for beginners to activate Cursor and get started.

---

## 🤳 Step 1 — Scan the QR Code

Use your phone to scan the QR code provided on paper.

This will:

- Take you to the Cursor dashboard
- Start the process to claim your credits

---

## 👤 Step 2 — Create or Log Into Cursor

If you don’t have an account yet:

1. Sign up with email
2. Verify your email
3. Log in

## 💳 Step 3 — Activate Pro Plan

Cursor requires at least a **Pro subscription** to use (via credits or otherwise):

- Add credit card info & subscribe to the Pro Plan
- You *will not be charged right away* because the QR credits cover it (for 1 month)
- This will allow you to actively use Cursor for the meetup/hackathon
- You are free to continue the subscription or cancel it afterwards

## 🧾 Step 4 — Confirm Credits

After activation:

- Check your credit balance on the dashboard
- Ensure you see the credit amount ($20)
- Apply it towards a Pro Plan subscription

If confused, ask a Cursor Volunteer for help!
